It does a great job of demystifying the process of setting up a website for beginners. Especially if you want to use WordPress. 
                        All plans include a free domain for the first year, great uptime (based on real-life data), a free CDN, an easy website builder, and a free SSL certificate. Everything you need is in one place for

                        <strong>Great Security:</strong>
                        <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/codewithclinton/" style="text-align:center; text-decoration:none">Bluehost</a> has one of the best security measures on the market. All Bluehost security features are efficient and will help you cut back hours of tweaking your website. 
                        It will also give you peace of mind, which is especially needed for absolute beginners. The most basic version of this security feature comes with 1GB storage space, daily backup and monitoring, and three restorations per month. However, 
                        for the more expensive plans like Choice Plus and Pro, you can expect free automatic backups for one year and 24/7 network monitoring.

                      <strong>Extensive and Fast Customer Support:</strong>
                     Another excellent feature of <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/codewithclinton/" style="text-align:center; text-decoration:none">Bluehost</a> is its extensive and fast customer support base. Customer support is paramount for any web hosting service to have, but finding a service that has fast and efficient support can be a dime a dozen. 

                    Luckily, Bluehost offers just that, and most users have said the customer support is very helpful when needing immediate support. In fact, there’s a high chance you will connect to Bluehost’s Live Chat system within five minutes of waiting. 
                    
                    All of its support-base is available 24/7, so you don’t need to worry about figuring out time zones. 
                    Bluehost also offers phone and email support, but the waiting times vary. However, 
                    you always have the option to pass the time by browsing its extensive knowledge base support forum for multiple FAQs, videos, 
                    in-depth articles, and support resources on everything web hosting related.

                  <li>
                      <strong>Easy to Use:</strong>
                     Not only is <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/codewithclinton/" style="text-align:center; text-decoration:none">Bluehost</a> the most popular web hosting service on the market for its outstanding features and products, but it’s also because it’s so incredibly easy to use. Ease of use is an important feature to have because web hosting can already be confusing to some, so there’s no need for the onboarding process to be difficult, too. 

                    Fear not though, as Bluehost has an easy onboarding process that takes a few minutes to complete, to get your website up and running. With an intuitive interface, it will ask you to fill out a form that includes your website goals, what you want to add to your site, and what you want your name and the tagline of your site to be. 
                    
                    After answering these questions, you get to choose a theme of your choice from the Bluehost Marketplace, and then it automatically installs WordPress for your ultimate convenience. All you have to worry about is customization, while Bluehost takes care of the backend and the technical nitty-gritty.

                  <li>
                      <strong>High-Performance Servers:</strong>
                     The last thing that’s great about <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/codewithclinton/" style="text-align:center; text-decoration:none">Bluehost</a> is that it offers very high-performance servers to all users purchasing the Pro plan. Although it’s not always ideal for every user to fork out more money, we think you get what you pay for. For $14.95 per month, you get access to Dual Quad Processor Performance Servers that will keep large ecommerce websites functioning effectively. 

                    This server is an excellent option for larger websites because Bluehost makes sure there are fewer users per server—with an individual file count of 300,000—so there are no slowdowns for anyone involved. 
                    
                    However, if you don’t want to pay the price for these servers, we still think regular Bluehost servers that come with the other plans are great and work just fine.
